### What Is Machine Learning?
- A general definition
```
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn 
without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel, 1959
```
- An engineering-oriented definition
```
A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, 
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. - Tom Mitchell, 1997
